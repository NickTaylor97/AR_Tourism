# AR_Tourism
Nick Taylor's BCMS Honors Thesis 2017
This repository contains the useful implementations I created during my research project.
All projects are zipped due to gits restrictions on files over 100mb.
These resources are all avaliabel for free use and hope they are of use to other augmented reality developers.
