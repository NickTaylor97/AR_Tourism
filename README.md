# AR_Tourism
Nick Taylor's BCMS Honors Thesis 2017
This repository contains the useful implementations I created during my research project.
All projects are zipped due to gits restrictions on files over 100mb.
These resources are all avaliable for free use and I hope they are of use to other augmented reality developers.
